**Thunder, Nuggets, and Rising Rookies Shine on Action-Packed NBA Saturday**

Opening week in the NBA continued with fireworks on Saturday, as the league’s young stars and perennial contenders delivered thrilling performances and statement victories. From Chet Holmgren’s sharpshooting in Atlanta to Nikola Jokic’s latest triple-double in Denver, the evening was packed with highlight-reel moments, breakout performances, and early-season drama. With several teams looking to build momentum and some rookies already making their mark, fans were treated to a glimpse of the excitement that promises to define the 2025-26 season.

The Oklahoma City Thunder once again flexed their championship pedigree, rolling past the Atlanta Hawks 117-100 behind monster outings from Chet Holmgren and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Holmgren was nearly unstoppable, pouring in 31 points with an eye-popping 6-of-8 shooting from beyond the arc, while Gilgeous-Alexander continued his MVP form with 30 points on just 11 shots inside the arc. The Thunder, now 3-0, have picked up right where they left off last season—combining star power and depth to overwhelm opponents, and making a strong case as early favorites to defend their title.

In Denver, Nikola Jokic reminded the league why he’s in the conversation for best player on the planet. The two-time MVP notched his 166th career triple-double with an efficient 14 points, 14 rebounds, and 15 assists, orchestrating a 133-111 rout of the Phoenix Suns. Jamal Murray led the Nuggets in scoring, but it was Jokic’s command of the offense—waiting until late in the second quarter to even attempt a shot—that showcased Denver’s confidence and balance. The shorthanded Suns, led by Devin Booker’s 31 points, simply couldn’t keep pace with the Nuggets’ offensive onslaught.

Rookies also took center stage on Saturday, none more so than Memphis’s Cedric Coward. The No. 11 overall pick erupted for 27 points—including a perfect 6-for-6 from deep—as the Grizzlies cruised past the Indiana Pacers, 128-103. With Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr. chipping in, Memphis bounced back emphatically after a disappointing loss the night before. Meanwhile in Chicago, the Bulls displayed impressive depth in a 110-98 win over Orlando, with new addition Josh Giddey posting 21 points and Ayo Dosunmu coming off the bench with a clutch fourth-quarter shooting spree.

The Philadelphia 76ers provided late-game drama in their home opener, edging out the Charlotte Hornets 125-121 thanks to a cold-blooded three from Quentin Grimes with 14 seconds left. Tyrese Maxey led the Sixers with 28 points, while Joel Embiid was quiet on the boards but contributed 20 points of his own. The Hornets’ night was marred by an injury to rising sophomore Brandon Miller, who exited in the second quarter with a sore shoulder, adding to Charlotte’s early-season woes.

Elsewhere around the league, teams continued to jockey for early positioning. (Note: No other NBA games were played on this date.)

As the season’s first week wraps up, the storylines are already compelling: defending champions looking dominant, new faces breaking out in a big way, and injuries beginning to shape team narratives. With so much action packed into the season’s opening days, fans can only expect the drama and excitement to ramp up from here.
