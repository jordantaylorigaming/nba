**NBA Recap: Curry and Gilgeous-Alexander Dazzle on a Night of Overtime Thrillers**

Opening week of the NBA 2025-26 season continued in electrifying fashion on October 23, as superstars delivered jaw-dropping performances and fans were treated to two overtime spectacles that underscored the league’s depth of talent and drama. The night was headlined by epic showdowns in San Francisco and Indianapolis, where the Golden State Warriors and Oklahoma City Thunder each needed extra periods—and some late-game heroics from their franchise players—to secure early-season statement wins against tough competition.

At Chase Center, Stephen Curry reminded the league why he remains one of its most captivating forces. The two-time MVP poured in 42 points, rallying the Warriors from a double-digit deficit to outlast the Denver Nuggets 137-131 in overtime. Curry’s ability to seize the moment was on full display: he drew a crucial foul on a three-pointer, hit the ensuing free throws, and then drilled a signature deep three to force overtime. While Aaron Gordon’s career-high 50 points nearly stole the show for Denver, it was Curry’s composure and clutch shooting that propelled Golden State to victory in a game that felt like a preview of playoff battles to come.

Meanwhile, in a rematch of last season’s NBA Finals, the Oklahoma City Thunder survived another marathon, defeating the Indiana Pacers 141-135 in double overtime. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander etched his name into the early MVP conversation with a career-best 55 points, including 15 in the overtime periods alone, showcasing both his stamina and flair for the dramatic. The Pacers, still reeling from the season-ending injury to Tyrese Haliburton and the offseason departure of Myles Turner, showed remarkable fight but ultimately couldn’t overcome Gilgeous-Alexander’s brilliance. The Thunder’s back-to-back double-overtime wins to start the season highlight their resilience and championship mettle.

Across the league, the night underscored a budding trend: the NBA’s brightest stars are taking on even larger roles for their franchises, often shouldering the scoring load in pivotal moments. With teams like Indiana and Denver relying on emerging or newly featured players—such as Gordon’s offensive explosion and the Pacers’ next-man-up mentality—the stage is set for a season filled with breakout performances and shifting hierarchies.

Beyond the night’s headline-grabbing contests, there was plenty of action around the league. The Boston Celtics edged out the Atlanta Hawks 114-110 in a tightly contested Eastern Conference battle, while the Phoenix Suns cruised past the Charlotte Hornets 125-108 behind a balanced scoring effort. The Memphis Grizzlies earned their first win of the season, grinding out a 102-97 road victory over the Dallas Mavericks, and the Toronto Raptors got a boost from their young core to topple the Orlando Magic 111-106 at home.

As the season’s first week unfolds, the NBA has wasted no time delivering the drama and individual brilliance fans crave. With superstars setting the pace and new storylines emerging by the day, the campaign promises plenty more nights like this—where overtime delivers heroes, and the league’s best rise to the occasion.
